Chamber temperature is key for optimal printing of ABS and other plastics. A chamber heater lets you easily control the air temperature, but requires careful considerations for a safe installation.

This SLM mount lets you secure the heater with only metal, ensuring that even in case of a runaway heater the mount doesn't melt. It is supposed to be paired with 3628 fans with good temperature resistance, like the deltas, that also achieve a high level of airflow.
The SLM part is not expensive, so it's an easy addition to any SLM order you want to make.
